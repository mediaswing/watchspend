//! Every word the interface says, looked up by key instead of written in place.
//!
//! A budgeting app is one of the few programs whose whole content is words and
//! numbers about somebody's own money, and the numbers are already handled:
//! [`crate::locale`] has always written `£12.34` for London and `12,34 €` for
//! Berlin from the same code. This module is the other half — the words —
//! written in another language by somebody who does not program. Language
//! files are plain text, they can be dropped into a folder without rebuilding
//! anything, and see [`catalogue`] for the format.
//!
//! Three properties are deliberate.
//!
//! **English is always there.** It is compiled into the binary and any key a
//! translation has not reached yet falls back to it, so a language file is
//! useful from its first line rather than only its last. Nobody has to finish
//! before they can test.
//!
//! **Lookups work from any thread.** The connection attempt in
//! [`crate::db::attempt`] builds its own failure messages on a background
//! thread, so the active language has to be reachable from them as well as
//! from the UI.
//!
//! **The lookup happens every frame**, not once at startup, which is what
//! makes changing language redraw the whole interface with no restart.
