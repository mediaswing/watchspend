//! Fonts, colour, and the choice between light and dark.
//!
//! The app has always followed whatever the operating system was set to. What
//! it did not have was a say in the matter, or a palette of its own: the two
//! themes were egui's defaults, which are not written down anywhere as pairs
//! and so cannot be reasoned about. Both are defined here instead, as explicit
//! colours with the contrast worked out — every text colour reaches at least
//! 4.5:1 against the surface it is drawn on, and the ones that carry meaning on
//! their own reach further.
//!
//! The palettes and the light/dark preference are the same design as the
//! `accessengine` app they came from. The metrics are this app's own: it is a
//! form somebody types money into, and its spacing was already tuned for that.
